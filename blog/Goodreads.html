<hr />

<p> You might think of <a href="https://www.goodreads.com">Goodreads.com</a> as a kind of anti-social social media. A low-key website with not too many users and a strange place where most people don’t even have a profile picture. It would seem like a safe haven where nerds can nerd out and geeks can geek it up. However, the result of having your books statistically tracked and judged by your friends takes a lot of enjoyment out of reading (to be fair, no one really cares, but you feel like they do).</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="its-a-numbers-game">It’s a numbers game</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<p> Every social media platform manipulates you with numbers. Twitter has retweets, Instagram with likes, Goodreads with the number on your “Read” shelf. The urge to add books to your “Read” shelf is fierce and when you do move a doorstopper of a book to it, it’s almost intoxicating. You can almost feel your IQ and friend’s respect for you go up. But then you realize you just read 6 100-page “Young Adult” books written at an 8th-grade level instead of any of the thoughtful novels you should have read.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p> If you’re an active on the site, then you’ll feel pretty good about yourself with your 100 read books while your friends have like 8. You’ll really feel like the man until you spot another active. A threat. You see they have over 350 books on their profile. That’s like 100 more than you do. You suddenly feel your coolness factor dropping. You click on their profile picture and see…..75 read and 275 to-read…<strong>HAHAHAHA</strong>. “What an absolute chump!” you say out loud to yourself. Your self-worth rises back to previous levels and maybe even a little bit higher. See these numbers become a sort of competition between you and others when it shouldn’t.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p> The yearly reading challenge is another tool by the sly devils at Goodreads. You think the challenge will hold you accountable and is just friendly competition with yourself, but it goes one of 2 ways:</p>

<ol>
  <li>You are like the 85%† of people on Goodreads and literally do not read more than 2 books this year. You come back next year with an “oh shittt” feeling and remember that reading was one of the options you could have spend your 5840 waking hours on last year. You are disappointed in yourself and don’t even bother next year.</li>
  <li>You maybe get 2/3rds of the way through a nice, long novel, put it away for a while, come back in a few months, and are now 2 books behind your challenge. So what do you do? You choose the quickest reads you can find to bring those numbers up. Over 200 pages? Fuck that. You end up hitting your challenge, but there is a slight empty feeling inside of you.</li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<h3 id="fixes">Fixes</h3>

<p><br /></p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t do the reading challenge.</strong></p>

    <p>Starting to read again is a valiant effort that shouldn’t result in you feeling like garbage because you only read 5 novels instead of the 15 you were expecting. You should be happy that you got through some novels you probably really enjoyed. You’ll end up becoming more and more consistent and will enjoy reading again like when you were younger.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Don’t add books to your “Currently Reading” shelf.</strong></p>

    <p>Moving a book into your currently reading shelf feels like signing a contract with the reading devil. Your friends see that you are starting <em>Infinite Jest</em> by David Foster Wallace. “Wow!” they say. You now feel obligated to finish it. Giving up and moving it back to the “read” shelf feels like failure. You grind through it, enjoying perhaps 1 paragraph every page. After months on reading maybe a couple pages a day, you move it to your “read” shelf and then don’t pick a book for the rest of the year.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p><br /></p>

<p> That last point was obviously an exaggeration, but sometimes people forget that reading can be <strong>really</strong> enjoyable. Getting so caught up in a story that I read on my walk to school and even the bathroom is a very rare and greatly satisfying experience. It’s okay to stop reading a book halfway if you don’t enjoy it; that particular book is probably not for you. Just move on to the next one and hopefully, it can give you the enthralling feeling that is so addicting.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p> The moving on part is so much easier if you don’t have a set number of books to read that year. Try some out like you would try clothes or a TV show. Just a few dozen pages. Does the language not vibe with you? Are the subject or characters insufferable? Put it down and try something new. You might think “oh but what if it turns out to be my favorite book ever?”. There are literally millions of books so through probability we can deduce it is likely not. There could be a book out there where you love each word with all your heart.</p>

<hr />

<p><em>In conclusion</em>, Life is too short to not read the books that you enjoy.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>But still, there’s a very low chance I will stop using Goodreads. Add me as a friend: <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/46243641-rooshi">My Goodreads profile</a></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>† I made this statistic up obviously, but check yourself and see how many of your friends completed any substantial portion of their challenge. Most people don’t even log in for a few years at a time.</p>

<p><br /></p>

<p><br /></p>

<p>* This post is not really serious. I just wanted to start writing something and this is what came to mind. I do not want to seem pretentious in the sense of “Oh yeah, of course I read I’m smart, and you don’t so you must be dumb”. If you look at the books I read, they are just YA fiction, Sci-fi, and some self-help books (you could probably learn a lot about me by my choice in non-fiction) so nothing even that heavy. My grammar is probably off too, but life is too short for perfect grammar :)</p>
